                                The Demonstration has been expanded upon from the example to have the button toggle between the different messages rather than just changing from the

                            <li>
                                JavaScript was a programming and scripting language developed 20 years ago by Brendan Eich who never would have thought it would become what it has 
                                today.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                JavaScript
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Mentioned as the de-facto standard assembly of the web.</li>
                                    <li>
                                        Used not only in browsers and the front end of web applications but also heavily on the server side for web application programming interfaces 
                                        like node.js.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Most commonly thought of as the most popular programming language in existence.</li>
                                    <li>An essential for any programmer or web developer to learn.</li>
                                    <li>
                                        JavaScript and Java are completely different languages, both in concept and design and JavaScript has nothing to do with Java.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>A heavy programming language requiring the installation of additional software on the system.</li>
                                            <li>The makers of JavaScript latched on to the free publicity and buzz that Java was getting in 1995.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.</li>
                                    <li>ECMA-262 is the official name. ECMAScript6 (released in June 2015) is the latest official version of JavaScript.</li>
                                    <li>
                                        JavaScript functions primarily within a host environment like a web browser although others such as Adobe PhotoShop, Adobe Acrobat, and NoSQL
                                        databases are fairly popular as well.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        JavaScript is primarily used as a client-side scripting language.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                                Means that most of the coding is written directly into the HTML page and parsed by the browser when the page is rendered on the 
                                                client.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>Primary function is to add to the level of interactivity on a what would otherwise have been a static page.</li>

                                    </li>

                                JavaScript is included in everyone's browser but you still must program the actions that you want to occur on the page and when you want them to 
                                occur.

                            <li>JavaScript is written in plain text just like HTML and CSS but does follow a very specific syntax which developers must learn.</li>
                            <li>
                                JavaScript is not a complied language but an interpreted language meaning you write the code and hand it over to the web browser and it takes care of 
                                everything.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>so no special complier is necessary.</li>
                                    <li>Simple text files and a browser that has JavaScript enabled is all we need.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>One of the MOST IMPORTANT things to remember about JavaScript is that it IS CASE SENSITIVE!!!!</li>
                            <li>
                                So everything that you do in JavaScript is case SENSITIVE

                                    <li>If you don't get the case right you won't see any errors, your JavaScript code will simply not work.</li>

                            <li>Sometimes variables will need to contain multiple values simultaneously which is referred to as an array.</li>
                            <li>Arrays are simply variables that hold multiple values with no theoretical limit to the number of values they can contain</li>
                            <li>
                                You can request a specific value for display or modification using the <i>index</i>

                                    <li>multiValues[2] = displays the value in the 3rd spot of the array because of the zero based index used in numbering the items in the array.</li>
                                    <li>multiValue[6] = "another string of text" - would set the value to item 6 or create it if it didn't exist.</li>

                            </li>

                                The code inside a function will execute when something invokes (calls) the function
                                <ul>
                                    <li>An event occurs - a user clicks a button</li>

                                    <li>Automatically (self-invoked)</li>
                                </ul>

                                Best practice is to define the function in the code before the function is called
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Functions should be defined early in the JavaScript file</li>
                                    <li>Functions are then called later in the file</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Functions can be defined globally or nested within other functions.</li>

                            <li>Most programming languages require you to declare variables using a particular type which tells the programming engine what data type to expect</li>
                            <li>JavaScript is different in that it is a "loosely typed" language and doesn't care the type of object its dealing with in most cases</li>
                            <li>The general types
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Numbers</li>
                                    <li>Strings</li>
                                    <li>Dates</li>
                                    <li>Objects</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Numbers in JavaScript o not have the intricacies that are present in other languages such as decimal, integer, large integer, floating point, etc.</li>
                            <li>
                                All numbers in JavaScript are assumed to be floating point integers which would cause a problem but since massive numeric calculations aren't 
                                usually performed in client-side code its not an issue.
                            </li>
                            <li>If you surround numbers in quotes they will no longer be treated like a number but instead will be assumed to be a string</li>
                            <li>
                                This could possibly cause an error in your code and so you can declare a value to be a number using the syntax
                                <br>var foo = "55";
                                <br>var myNumber = number(foo);
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                In addition to explicitly typing a variable you can use the built in JavaScript function NaN (Is Not a Number) in order to test the value of a 
                                variable.
                            </li>
                            <li>You can write an else statement if you actually want to check and verify that something IS a number.</li>
                            <li>The Math object in JavaScript can perform some very useful operations for developers using JavaScript</li>
                            <li>Strings are used for storing and manipulating text and the text can be inside single quotes or double quotes but not both
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Can't start with single quotes and end with double quotes.</li>
                                    <li>Can't use the same quotes more than once inside a string</li>
                                    <li>Can use quotes inside a string as long as they are not the same as the outside quotes.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>When you have a situation where you need to include special characters (like quotes) inside of a string value you have two options

                            <li>Nearly everything in JavaScript can be an object:<br>Booleans, Numbers, Strings, Dates, Maths, Regular expressions, Arrays, Functions, Objects</li>
                            <li>Basically everything except for primitive values are objects but even those can be created as objects.</li>
                            <li>Objects are simply variables containing variables

                                    <li>The name:value pairs are referred to as properties</li>
                                    <li>Methods are actions that can be performed on objects

                            <li>You can create JavaScript objects in various ways
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Define and create a single object using an object literal</li>
                                    <li>Define and create a single object using the keyword new</li>
                                    <li>Define an object constructor and then create objects of the constructed type</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Creating a single object using an object literal is the easiest way to create a JavaScript object.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>You both define and create the object in a single statement</li>
                                    <li>Uses a list of name:value pairs inside {}</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>The 2nd option is to use the NEW keyword to create an object though this is deemed unnecessary</li>
                            <li>The previous methods for creating objects are limited to creating a single object</li>
                            <li>There are times when you would like to create an object "type" that can then be reused to create multiple objects of a single type</li>
                            <li>The way to achieve this is to use the 3rd option of creating objects by using an object constructor function</li>
                            <li>The properties are the most important parts of an object
                                <ul>
                                    <li>They are the values associated with an object</li>
                                    <li>A collection of unordered properties</li>
                                    <li>Can usually be added, changed, and deleted though some are read-only</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Syntax

                                    <li>objectName.property - person.firstName</li>
                                    <li>objectName["property"] - person["firstName"]</li>

                            <li>Object methods are actions that can be performed on objects</li>
                            <li>Essentially methods are properties that contain a function definition</li>
                            <li>
                                You create object methods using this syntax
                                <ul>
                                    <li>MethodName:function() {executable code}</li>

                            </li>
                            <li>You then access the method using this syntax
                                <ul>
                                    <li>objectName.methodName()</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Every JavaScript object has a prototype and the prototype is also an object
                                <ul>
                                    <li>New objects inherit their properties and methods from their prototype</li>
                                    <li>Objects created using an object literal or with new Object() inherit from the Object.prototype</li>
                                    <li>Objects created from a particular object like new Date() would inherit from the Date prototype</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>You can create object prototypes to then use in creating additional objects and you do so using an object constructor function</li>
                            <li>You can add properties or methods
                                <ul>
                                    <li>To existing objects</li>
                                    <li>To all existing objects of a specific type</li>

                            <li>Adding to objects only changes the object in question but adding to the prototype will modify new objects created using that prototype</li>

                                The web page is the script upon which we are working so we must be able to reach into the page to get information and have the page respond back to 
                                our code.
                            </li>
                            <li>Understanding the DOM is the way to do that, it is an incredibly important part of understanding the functionality of JavaScript.</li>

                                    <li>It's a fairly vague term</li>

                                The web definition is "The Document Object Model is an application programming interface that defines logical structure of well-formed an XML and

                            <li>Accessing DOM elements is the first step but often we would like to modify those elements either entirely or in part, such as attributes</li>
                            <li>One such way of changing elements is to modify the content which is performed using the innerHTML property</li>

                            <li>Another way in which the HTML can be changed is to actually modify the style that is used using CSS properties</li>
                            <li>Any CSS styles can be modified on page load or based on events on the page

                            <li>Thus far our code has been loaded along with the web page which is really not very useful</li>
                            <li>JavaScript is supposed to control the behavior of the page and its interactivity with the user which means that our code should be able to respond to actions that are taken on the page</li>
                            <li>This is where events and event listeners come into play
                                <ul>
                                    <li>You don't cause the events they are occurring all the time.</li>
                                    <li>You choose which of these events that you want to respond to</li>
                                    <li>You write an event listener in order to handle those particular events and respond the way that you would like</li>

                                    <li>Write the JavaScript code directly into the HTML</li>
                                    <li>Specify the element and event you want to handle and write a function</li>
                                    <li>Use the addEventListener() function</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>The first option is a simple option and is often done but really not recommended
                                <ul>
                                    <li>It mixes the HTML code and the JavaScript</li>
                                    <li>Its not very portable</li>
                                    <li>Generally not a good idea</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>The 2nd option is often the best and involves identifying the element that you want to act upon and the event that
                                you would like to respond to
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The element is referenced by using a variable</li>
                                    <li>The event is chose from the list of possible events</li>
                                    <li>An anonymous function is created that contains the code that you want to run</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>The 3rd option used the addEventListener() method</li>

                                    <li>The function that you want to call</li>
                                    <li>True or False</li>
